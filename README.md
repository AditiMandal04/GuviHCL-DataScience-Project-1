Student Performance Analysis Report

Objective: To analyze and visualize student marks across multiple subjects, calculate grades, and identify the top performer.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
Input:
Number of students (n)
For each student:
Name
Marks in 3 subjects (floating-point values)

2. Calculations
For Each Student:
Total Marks: Sum of marks in all 3 subjects.
Average Marks: Total / 3
Grade Assignment:
A: ≥ 90
B: ≥ 80 & < 90
C: ≥ 70 & < 80
D: ≥ 60 & < 70
F: < 60
For the Entire Class:
Class Average: Mean of all students' averages.
Topper Identification: Student with the highest average.

3. Visualization
Grouped Bar Chart (Student Marks per Subject)
X-axis: Students
Y-axis: Marks (0-100)
Bars:
Each student has 3 bars (one per subject).
Color-coded:
Subject 1: Blue
Subject 2: Green
Subject 3: Orange
Topper Highlighting:
Red border + hatch pattern on the topper's bars.
Annotated callout box with topper’s name and average.
Text Report
Displays:
Student names, subject-wise marks, total, average, and grade.
